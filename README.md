Hey guys, manker03 here! I'm currently a student at Virignia Tech studying Computer Science. 

Coding for me is really a safety net and just a skill I want to be good at. I plan on
commissioning into the air force, and most likely not doing a coding-related job. I like lifting, sports,
and the outdoors. I do enjoy a good 6-hour coding session every few days, though!

If you're interested, message me here and I can provide my LinkedIn, email, or phone number.
